Asynchronous programming allows non-blocking execution by using callbacks, promises, or async/await. For example, to handle an asynchronous API call, we can use async/await: `const fetchData = async () => { try { const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); const data = await response.json(); console.log(data); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } };`",

NoSQL databases like MongoDB are schema-less and excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility and scalability. MongoDB is preferable when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data or when the data model is expected to evolve over time, such as in real-time analytics or content management systems.",
