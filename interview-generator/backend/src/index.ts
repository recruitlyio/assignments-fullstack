    Generate 5-7 **practical, real-world** technical interview questions for **each skill area**.
    - Questions should **test practical application** (how candidates would use skills in real projects).
    - Difficulty and depth must match the candidate's **experience level**.
    - Progressively increase difficulty while maintaining alignment with the candidateâ€™s experience level.
    - For each question, provide clear evaluation criteria that explain what constitutes a strong response. The criteria should outline the key points or skills the candidate should demonstrate in their answer.
    OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
    {
      "Skill Area 1": [
        {
          "question": "question text here",
          "evaluationCriteria": "what a good answer should include"

        ...
      ],
      "Skill Area 2": [
        ...

    Keep questions concise, realistic, and avoid theoretical-only questions. 
    No extra commentary outside of the JSON.
