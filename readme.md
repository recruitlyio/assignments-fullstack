## Evaluation Criteria

Regardless of which challenge you choose, we'll evaluate your submission on:

1. **Problem Solving**: How you approach and decompose a complex problem
2. **AI Integration**: Strategic use of LLMs beyond simple prompt engineering
3. **Code Quality**: Structure, readability, and maintainability
4. **System Design**: Architecture decisions and technical tradeoffs
5. **Functionality**: Effectiveness of your solution for the intended use case

## Time Expectation

Each challenge is designed to take approximately 4-8 hours. We value your time and don't expect a production-ready system. Focus on demonstrating your approach and technical thinking rather than perfecting every detail.

## Submission Process

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (`your-name-solution`)
3. Implement your solution
4. Submit a pull request with a summary of your approach
5. Include setup instructions in your README
