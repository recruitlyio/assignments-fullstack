<!-- Welcome to our technical assessment repository! This collection of challenges is designed to evaluate your ability to build AI-powered recruitment tools that solve real-world problems.

## Instructions

1. Review the challenges below
2. Choose ONE that best matches your skills and interests
3. Fork this repository and implement your solution
4. Submit a pull request with your completed challenge

## About Our Platform

We are building an Agentic recruitment platform with specialized agents that automate key aspects of the hiring process. Our technology stack includes React, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern AI/LLM integrations.

## Challenge Options

Choose ONE of the following challenges:

### [Advanced Candidate Matching System](./candidate-matcher.md)
Design an intelligent system that matches candidates to jobs by understanding skill equivalence, experience depth, and potential fit.

### [Intelligent Resume Parser](./resume-analyzer.md)
Build a system that extracts structured, validated data from unstructured resume content.

### [Candidate Engagement Chatbot](./candidate-engagement-bot.md)
Create a conversational agent that provides job information while qualifying candidates through natural dialogue.

### [Technical Interview Question Generator](./interview-generator.md)
Develop a tool that generates tailored technical interview questions with appropriate difficulty calibration.

## Evaluation Criteria

Regardless of which challenge you choose, we'll evaluate your submission on:

1. **Problem Solving**: How you approach and decompose a complex problem
2. **AI Integration**: Strategic use of LLMs beyond simple prompt engineering
3. **Code Quality**: Structure, readability, and maintainability
4. **System Design**: Architecture decisions and technical tradeoffs
5. **Functionality**: Effectiveness of your solution for the intended use case

## Time Expectation

Each challenge is designed to take approximately 4-8 hours. We value your time and don't expect a production-ready system. Focus on demonstrating your approach and technical thinking rather than perfecting every detail.

## Submission Process

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (`your-name-solution`)
3. Implement your solution
4. Submit a pull request with a summary of your approach
5. Include setup instructions in your README

We're excited to see your creative solutions to these challenges!
